    <h1>Keto Shrimp Scampi</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This shrimp scampi is transformed into a keto meal by using shirataki noodles. I like to double the amount of crushed red chiles for an extra kick! This will make 3 lunch-sized portions or 2 dinner-sized portions. Grate some Parmesan cheese on top before serving, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages shirataki noodles, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced shallot</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>12 ounces raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover shirataki noodles with water and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Return drained noodles to the saucepan and cook over medium heat to remove any excess moisture, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and stir until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Take care not to burn. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; stir for 1 minute. Add shrimp and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, taking care not to overcook. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Transfer shrimp to a bowl, reserving pan drippings in the skillet. Whisk lemon juice and white wine into the skillet. Add butter and cook until fully incorporated and sauce begins to thicken slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return shrimp to the skillet. Add noodles. Sprinkle with parsley and toss to combine.</li>
    </ol>
